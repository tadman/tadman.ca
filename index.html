          Solving problems through programming is one of the most empowering
          things. That you can can command a machine capable of billions of
          operations per second with a few simple keystrokes is still
          fundamentally amazing to me. That today you can do this with your
          phone and manipulate a computer on the other side of the world is
          even more bewildering.

          As incredible as this all is, the most important thing to remember is
          we're only just getting started. Who knows what the future has in store,
          but each of us are able to do our little bit to shape it the way we want
          it to be.
